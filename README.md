## Licensing

Uranium *used* to be a paid template on [Gumroad](https://saurish.gumroad.com/l/uranium), but after feedback and personal thought, I've decided to make it open-source. That being said, it is distributed underneath the GNU GPLv3 license, which requires a few conditions available [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/). If you would like to purchase a license to bypass those conditions, please [reach out to me](#Contact).
