# Uranium

## Note

Thank you for purchasing Uranium! Please note a few things:

1. The purchasing of Uranium does not include me coding your website – it is only a template for **you** to use. This means that you must develop the website _individually_.
2. Unauthorized distribution of Uranium is not allowed. To clarify, you may utilize this template for multiple projects (and you do not need to purchase the template again), but you may not _send_ this template to others either. Please heed this warning and ensure that only you have access to this template.
3. Do not use portions of Uranium for profit – i.e. do not try to "flip" this template or use portions of the template for monetary gain.
4. Basically: be a good soul & do not do things that could potentially hurt the sales of Uranium.
